|Conway's Game Of Life|
-----------------------
Program imitates life - a cell will either survive or die based on the # of neighbors. 2 or 3 it survives, any
other number it dies. Dead cells revive if they're surrounded by exactly 3 neighbors. This continues for a specified
amount of generations. Other functionalities include: pausing, resetting, adjusting generation timer, editing colors
for cells.

Used Swing's components and its layout managers to create a user interface, multithreading, Random class, lambda
expressions, ActionListeners and more to finish this task.
