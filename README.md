|Conway's Game Of Life|
-----------------------
Program imitates life - a cell will either survive or die based on the # of neighbors. 2 or 3 it survives, any
other number it dies. Dead cells revive if they're surrounded by exactly 3 neighbors. This continues for a specified
amount of generations. Other functionalities include: pausing, resetting, adjusting generation timer, editing colors
for cells.

Used Swing's components and its layout managers to create a user interface, multithreading, Random class, lambda
expressions, ActionListeners and more to finish this task.

|Readability Score|
-------------------
Implemented 4 different readability tests to check the reading level of text along with recommendations
on the age level of the reader. Readability tests tracked # of Syllables, PolySyllables, Words, & Sentences 
to calculate the difficulty of the text. Includes a basic user interface that asks for commands.

Used regex, arrays, reading files, type-casting and user-defined methods to accomplish this task.

|Numeral System Converter| 
--------------------------
Program converts a number from it's source base/radix to it's target base/radix. It can convert Binary to
Octal, 35 base to Decimal, Hexadecimal to 1 base, etc. The number will also have its fractional part converted
and will be rounded up to 5 decimal places. For radixes outside of the range 1 to 36 it will display an error.

Used Functional Based Logic over Exception Based Logic, scanners, Integer and Character methods() to convert 
values into different bases, StringBuilder and user-defined methods to accomplish this task.


|Text Editor|
-----------------------
Created a basic Text Editor with file save, load, search options along with a user interface created from Swing 
components. Added Shortcut Keys, a regex and regular search (along with next and previous occurences), and image
icons.
